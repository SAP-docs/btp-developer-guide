# Automated SAP BTP Instrastructure Setup

Terraform is the de-facto industry standard for infrastructure as code with more than 3000 providers. With the Terraform provider for SAP BTP, you can now use this standard to create Terraform scripts that set up your SAP BTP landscapes. Given the nature of Terraform, it is even possible to add non-SAP infrastructure to those scripts if the infrastructure provider offers a Terraform provider as well.

The Terraform provider for SAP BTP enables you to automate the provisioning, management, and configuration of resources on SAP BTP. By leveraging this provider, you can simplify and streamline the deployment and maintenance of SAP BTP services and applications. See [Terraform Provider for SAP BTP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SAP/btp/latest/docs).

Currently, the Terraform provider for SAP BTP is available for non-productive use and SAP is working with several customers on shaping the first release for productive use. You can check out some of the Terraform scripts in a samples repository in the [GitHub repository for the Terraform Provider for SAP BTP](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-terraform-samples).
