## Reuse of Existing ABAP Developer Skillset

ABAP Cloud builds on familiar language elements and tools, enabling you to reuse their existing knowledge and transition smoothly into cloud development. This reuse of existing knowledge lowers the entry barrier and accelerates development in the cloud.

## Reuse of Existing ABAP Code

Existing ABAP logic from legacy or on-premise systems can be adapted and reused in the SAP BTP ABAP environment using tools such as the ABAP Test Cockpit and the Custom Code Migration App.

## Aligned Development Model

The ABAP Cloud development model is used both in SAP BTP ABAP environment and natively within all versions of SAP S/4HANA. This enables a consistent development experience across side-by-side and on-stack extensions, allowing you to use the same tools, patterns, and lifecycle processes.

## Seamless SAP S/4HANA Integration

SAP BTP ABAP environment follows the same identity and access management and connectivity concepts \(for example, SAP Identity Authentication service, RFC, OData\) as SAP S/4HANA. This ensures seamless interoperability between the systems and simplifies user and role management. With the modern communication management concept in ABAP Cloud, there is one common approach for all integration irrespective of the integration target. With the service consumption model in ABAP Cloud, a lot of the code is auto-generated allowing you to focus on the core business logic for which the integration was done.

The SAP BTP ABAP environment also offers a vast list of pre-built connectors \(communication scenarios\) to other services in SAP BTP and remote APIs on SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

## Installable Product as On-Stack Option

In addition to the classic multitenant SaaS model, the Installable Product option offers partners a second delivery approach for their solutions. Unlike multitenant SaaS solutions, which are hosted and operated by the partner in a shared environment, an Installable Product is deployed directly into the customer’s own SAP BTP ABAP environment and runs within their individual subaccount in SAP BTP.

The Installable Product option is particularly attractive for partners and customers who prefer or require the solution to run within the customer’s own landscape, similar to a cloud add-on. It gives customers full control over the deployed application, including lifecycle management and operational aspects such as data access and governance.

Customers using SAP BTP ABAP environment can browse for available Installable Products in the SAP Store, register for the solution, and deploy it directly into their system using the Landscape Portal.

Both multitenant SaaS and Installable Product options are fully supported and can be selected based on the customer’s and partner’s specific needs.

## Tool Support for Partners via Landscape Portal

The Landscape Portal provides integrated tooling for partners to build, test, and deploy their products, making it a key enabler for delivering both SaaS and Installable Product offerings as part of the SAP BTP product ecosystem.
