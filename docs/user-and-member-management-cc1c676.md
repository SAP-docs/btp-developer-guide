# User and Member Management

On SAP BTP, member management happens at all levels from global account to environment, while user management is done for business applications.

## User Accounts

A user account corresponds to a particular user in an identity provider, such as the default identity provider or a custom tenant of the Identity Authentication service.

**User accounts** enable users to log on to SAP BTP and access subaccounts and use services according to the permissions given to them.

Before diving into the different user and member management concepts, it's important to understand the difference between the different types of users weâ€™re referring to: **Platform users** and **business users**.

In a user's overview, you can create and delete users, and assign role collections. You can also display an overview of the role collections, where you can drill down all the way to the role, and see the application that the role is belongs to.") :arrow_upper_right:
