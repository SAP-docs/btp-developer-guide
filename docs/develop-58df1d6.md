## The Recommended Path

This development approach offers guidance for important development decisions and features proven best practices recommended by SAP. You can follow a model path for application and service development that is based on the Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\). When working with CAP, we recommend using Java and Node.js because they receive the highest level of tool support and are well suited for most use cases. This path provides you with a list of key aspects to consider, but the order shown in these steps isn't mandatory. You can adapt the steps as you wish to better fit your use case.
