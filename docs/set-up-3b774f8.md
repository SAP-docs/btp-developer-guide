## Set Up Your Account Model

The hierarchical structure between global accounts, directories, and subaccounts lets you define an account model that accurately fits your business and development needs. See [Setting Up Your Account Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/best-practices/setting-up-your-account-model?version=Cloud) in the SAP BTP Administrator's Guide.

## Set Up the SAP BTP Infrastructure Automatically Using the Terraform Provider

The Terraform provider for SAP BTP enables you to automate the provisioning, management, and configuration of resources on SAP BTP. By leveraging this provider, you can simplify and streamline the deployment and maintenance of SAP BTP services and applications. See [Automated SAP BTP Infrastructure Setup](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/df50977d8bfa4c9a8a063ddb37113c43/6bdb3a7170b84254bfaf0df52a112980.html?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=Cloud#loio6dd97e11cae44afa809351e1222aafd8).

## Manage Users and Members

User accounts enable users to log on to SAP BTP and access subaccounts and use services according to the permissions given to them. In this context, it's important to understand the difference between the two types of users that we refer to: platform users and business users.

Platform users are usually developers, administrators or operators who deploy, administer, and troubleshoot applications and services on SAP BTP.

Business users use the applications that are deployed in SAP BTP. For example, the end users of SaaS applications or services.

See [User and Member Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/user-and-member-management?version=Cloud) in the SAP Business Technology Platform documentation.
