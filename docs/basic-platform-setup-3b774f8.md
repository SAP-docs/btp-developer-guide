# Basic Platform Setup

Before you begin developing your applications, make sure your organizational and landscape setup is appropriate for managing their lifecycles.

## Create a Governance Model

One of the first and most important steps of your journey to the cloud is to establish an appropriate organizational setup and corresponding governance model. A clear and well-thought-out organizational setup makes it easier for your employees to adopt agile processes. See [Creating a Governance Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/best-practices/creating-governance-model?version=Cloud) in the Best Practices for SAP BTP guide.

## Set Up Your Account Model

The hierarchical structure between global accounts, directories, and subaccounts lets you define an account model that accurately fits your business and development needs. See [Setting Up Your Account Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/best-practices/setting-up-your-account-model?version=Cloud) in the Best Practices for SAP BTP guide.

## Manage Users and Members

User accounts enable users to log on to SAP BTP and access subaccounts and use services according to the permissions given to them. In this context, it's important to understand the difference between the two types of users that we refer to: platform users and business users.

Platform users are usually developers, administrators or operators who deploy, administer, and troubleshoot applications and services on SAP BTP.

Business users use the applications that are deployed in SAP BTP. For example, the end users of SaaS applications or services.

See [User and Member Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/user-and-member-management?version=Cloud) in the SAP Business Technology Platform documentation.
