When you want to have fully-detailed observability data of your application, you can use the SAP Cloud Logging service.

SAP Cloud Logging enables you to analyze your SAP BTP workloads on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime and SAP BTP, Kyma runtime regarding functional and non-functional behavior. The ability to look into the details of logs, metrics, and traces can be used to better understand performance, errors, usage, and other characteristics.

SAP Cloud Logging can be flexibly consumed, and costs are charged exactly along the actual usage. See [SAP Cloud Logging in the Service Catalog](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/index.html#/serviceCatalog/cloud-logging) in SAP Discovery Center.
