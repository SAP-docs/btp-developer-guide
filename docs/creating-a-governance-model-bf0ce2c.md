# Creating a Governance Model

One of the first and most important steps of your journey to the cloud is to establish an appropriate organizational setup and corresponding governance model. A clear and well-thought-out organizational setup makes it easier for your employees to adopt agile processes.

We also recommend that before you begin your development project, you create an onboarding process and a knowledge transfer process.

For example:

-   Define team setups \(including IT support roles and responsibilities\)

-   Create an onboarding process for development projects

-   Create a knowledge transfer process for the involved teams

-   Define support processes, operations documentation, and involved tools

-   Define activities to ramp up resources and implement changes \(support processes, tools, documentation\)

-   Clarify help desk processes and incident and change management
