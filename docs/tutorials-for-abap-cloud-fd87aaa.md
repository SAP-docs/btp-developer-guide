# Tutorials for ABAP Cloud

The ABAP Cloud best practices are documented in the form of step-by-step tutorials for learning how to develop and deploy full-stack transactional and analytical applications using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model \(RAP\) and embedded analytics.

The exercises are based on the Travel sample application of the [Flight Reference Scenario](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-refscen-flight) that is the best practice example for developing, deploying, and operating a full-stack application using ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model \(RAP\) and SAP Fiori.

You can also go through the [Develop a Full-Stack RAP Application Following the SAP BTP Developer’s Guide](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/4380/4666/) that is based on the Travel sample application. This mission has three main parts. The first part contains the RAP100 basics, for building an SAP Fiori application with RAP. The second part is for creating, developing, and integrating an SAP Fiori application. The third part builds on top of RAP100 basics and contains the intermediate tutorials, with additions such as dynamic feature control and ABAP unit tests.

There are additional learning resources and certifications you can use:

## Analytical Scenario

The analytical scenario shows the end-to-end development of an analytical application. It consists of a business service exposing an analytical query and a report built with SAP Analytics Cloud. The analytical report can be used to analyze complex situations and freely interact with large amounts of data in real time.

The analytical scenario is provided in the form of tutorials with beginner and intermediate experience levels:

-   Beginner: [Develop and Consume Queries on SAP Analytics Cloud](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-analytics.html)
-   Intermediate: [Develop Queries Based on Booking Supplement and Consume on SAP Analytics Cloud](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-booking-supplements-analytics.html)

## Transactional Scenario

The transactional scenario shows the end-to-end development of a transactional SAP Fiori elements list report application. It consists of an OData-based business service built with RAP and an SAP Fiori elements-based UI. It also shows the deployment of the SAP Fiori application in the ABAP environment and its integration in the local SAP Fiori launchpad for SAP BTP ABAP environment.

You will develop a simple, transactional list report application, the Travel Processing application, that is used by a department responsible for processing worldwide travel for multiple agencies.

The transactional scenario built with RAP is provided as a tutorial mission, which is divided into three tutorial groups with beginner and intermediate experience levels.

The following beginner tutorial groups are available for the transactional scenario:
