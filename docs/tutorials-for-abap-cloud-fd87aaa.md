# Tutorials for ABAP Cloud

The ABAP Cloud best practices are documented in the form of step-by-step tutorials for learning how to develop and deploy full-stack transactional and analytical applications using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model \(RAP\) and embedded analytics.

The exercises are based on the Travel example of the [Flight Reference Scenario](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-refscen-flight).

## Analytical Scenario

The analytical scenario shows the end-to-end development of an analytical application. It consists of a business service exposing an analytical query and a report built with SAP Analytics Cloud. The analytical report can be used to analyze complex situations and freely interact with large amounts of data in real time.

The analytical scenario is provided in the form of tutorials with beginner and intermediate experience levels.

## Transactional Scenario

The transactional scenario shows the end-to-end development of a transactional SAP Fiori elements list report application. It consists of an OData-based business service built with RAP and an SAP Fiori elements-based UI. It also shows the deployment of the SAP Fiori application in the ABAP environment and its integration in the local SAP Fiori Launchpad for SAP BTP, ABAP Environment.

You will develop a simple, transactional list report application, the Travel Processing application, that is used by a department responsible to process worldwide travels for multiple agencies.

The transactional scenario built with RAP is provided as a tutorial mission, which is divided into three tutorial groups with beginner and intermediate experience levels.

The following beginner tutorial groups are available for the transactional scenario:
