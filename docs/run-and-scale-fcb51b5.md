# Run and Scale

There are two things you have to take into account to ensure your application is working properly, and bringing value:

-   Get constant feedback from your users and optimize the application based on this feedback.

-   Monitor and operate the application using the services and capabilities SAP BTP offers.

    See [Operate](operate-34065a4.md).

## **Security Considerations in the Run and Scale Phase**

In the run and scale phase, you operate, monitor, and scale your application to ensure high availability, performance, and adaptability to growing user demands. Integrating security at this stage is essential to protect against evolving threats, maintain regulatory compliance, and support secure, scalable operations.

This phase ensures your application remains responsive and resilient as usage increases. For example, a retail company operating an e-commerce platform must defend against runtime threats such as unauthorized access or suspicious activity, while also ensuring secure auto-scaling during peak shopping periods.

By leveraging built-in security features of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) and ABAP Cloud, you can significantly strengthen your application defenses. Key practices include:

-   **Continuous threat monitoring** using SAP BTP observability tools to detect and respond to anomalies in real time.
-   Applicable for CAP: **Secure auto-scaling** with CAP mechanisms that dynamically manage resources while preserving tenant isolation and enforcing security policies.

Implementing these practices helps you mitigate operational risks, comply with standards like GDPR and PCI DSS, and deliver a secure, reliable user experience at scale.

The following table summarizes the security guidelines you need to be familiar with:
