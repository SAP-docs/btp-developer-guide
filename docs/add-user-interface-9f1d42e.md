# Add User Interface

SAPUI5 has guidelines for a wide range of developers and SAP Fiori is a set of design and guideline choices using SAPUI5.

If it is a new standard project, use SAPUI5 or SAP Fiori as it has the complete set of controls and provides the best support.

If a project is using HTML or an External framework for example it is a UI that has been part of a company that was acquired, use a micro frontend framework like Luigi to integrate with other pages, Launchpad, and others, and slowly migrate to SAPUI5. To ease the migration or if the UI will not be further developed, then SAPUI5 Provides CSS Libraries, reusable web components and guidance for a few frameworks to match the visual style and guidelines.

## Issues When Not Using SAPUI5

These are the issues that you have to consider if you are not using SAPUI5:

-   Custom controls break consistency.

-   Extensibility is defined for SAPUI5 and would be different for other frameworks and may require knowledge of these frameworks.

-   Support and stable releases for a longer duration are provided by SAPUI5 compared to the other frameworks.

-   SAPUI5 ensures a product standard support on application level. The Web Components and Component Toolkits for the different Web UI Frameworks ensure a product standard compliance on UI element level.

-   For LC/NC support, only SAPUI5 is supported.
