## Overview

The goal of the SAP BTP Developer’s Guide is to help you implement business applications on SAP BTP. This guide explains the building blocks for developing, delivering, and integrating business applications.

Development projects for business applications have similar characteristics. Standardized development guidance is driving developer efficiency.

Based on the experiences of successful business applications, this guide condenses best practices and technologies that can be safely recommended to you. These recommendations include:

-   A blueprint with a curated list of services that implement the standard nucleus of SAP business applications on SAP BTP.

-   An automated SAP BTP Infrastructure setup that handles provisioning, management, and configuration of resources on SAP BTP.

-   A standard set of technologies that ensure smooth integrations.

-   Guidance for delivering SAP cloud qualities and intelligent enterprise suite qualities.


The SAP BTP Developer’s Guide recommends the ABAP Cloud and SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) as the best architecture styles to implement for business applications. Both programming models integrate with SAP BTP services.

The SAP BTP Developer’s Guide complements existing documentation, such as the Best Practices for SAP BTP guide, by providing guidance concerning the recommended process to implement business applications on SAP BTP, especially for developers. See [Best Practices for SAP BTP](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/best-practices/best-practices-for-sap-btp?version=Cloud).

## ABAP Cloud

ABAP Cloud reflects the modern way to develop ABAP. It allows you to build lifecycle-stable and cloud-ready business applications, services, and extensions.

ABAP Cloud provides tools and techniques that ensure cloud qualities, promotes new technologies, contains a cloud-optimized subset of the ABAP language, and makes upgrade cycles easier by a clear separation between custom code and SAP code by only using released APIs and objects.

## SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It supports the most widely adopted languages, which are: Java \(with Spring Boot\), JavaScript, and TypeScript \(with Node.js\). CAP guides developers along a path of proven best practices and a great wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

CAP-based projects benefit from a primary focus on the domain. Instead of delving into overly technical disciplines, CAP focuses on accelerated development and safeguarding investments in a world of rapidly changing cloud technologies.

Here are some of the benefits that come with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\):

-   Built-in best practices

-   Support for Visual Studio Code and SAP Business Application Studio tools

-   Safeguarded application development investments

-   No runtimes lock-in

-   Reuse and integration of SAP BTP application services

-   Latest UX and themes
