### Business Application Services

SAP BTP supports Cloud Foundry, Kyma, and ABAP runtimes. It features a number of tools and programming languages that increase your flexibility and freedom when developing applications. You can choose the runtime that best suits your use cases and skill set and get to work. You also have the possibility to integrate applications you’ve built with other solutions by SAP.

As business applications have common characteristics, you can benefit from an open architecture with as few as possible, but well documented, technology choices.

The architecture blueprint outlines ABAP Cloud and SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) as the best architecture styles to implement business applications. Both programming models integrate with SAP BTP services.
