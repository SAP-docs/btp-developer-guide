# Development Guidance

In SAP BTP, you have the choice between several runtimes. If you want to run ABAP, you'll choose the [SAP BTP, ABAP environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/abap-environment/abap-environment).

The non-ABAP runtime options are SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime and SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. Both runtimes can be used to host and run your custom code, while at the same time being connected to SAP BTP Multi-Cloud Services and your on-premise systems. Depending on your use case and the skill set of your developers, choose the runtime that fits your needs. See [Comparison: SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime and SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/comparison-kyma-runtime-and-cloud-foundry-runtime/runtime-comparison?version=Cloud).
