# Tutorials for SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

The Incident Management sample application is a showcase of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) and adheres to the development recommendations set out in the SAP BTP Developer’s Guide. Best practices are documented in step-by-step tutorials based on the Incident Management application for learning how to develop, deploy, and operate a full-stack application using CAP and SAP Fiori. The tutorials also show how to use a set of important SAP BTP services in a CAP application.

When going through the sample application, you can choose from two options to try its services and runtimes before you purchase them:

-   Free tier for SAP BTP is best for productive projects:

    -   Access a productive account

    -   Start with more than 30 free-tier services and upgrade from free to paid plans

    -   Accelerate your ramp-up with boosters and missions that include step-by-step guidance


    The free-tier offering is available in the following consumption-based commercial models: the **SAP BTPEA** \(SAP BTP Enterprise Agreement\), the **CPEA** \(Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement\) and **Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP**. See [Using Free Service Plans](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans).

-   SAP BTP trial is best for learning purposes:

    -   Gain instant and full access to a trial environment

    -   Experiment with a diverse range of more than 30 trial services for free

    -   Get started with a variety of learning materials, such as tutorials and missions


    See [Start your free 90-days trial](https://www.sap.com/registration/trial.908cb719-0e03-421c-a091-daca045f0acc.html).


Before you start using the services or runtimes, you need to manage your entitlements and add quotas to your subaccounts. See [Entitlements and Quotas](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00aa2c23479d42568b18882b1ca90d79.html "When you purchase an enterprise account, you’re entitled to use a specific set of resources, such as the amount of memory that can be allocated to your applications.") :arrow_upper_right:.

Note that if you want to try out services for free, you need to select free tier service plans, if available. For a list of free services, check the Service Catalog at [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/servicessearch/Free%20Tier/).

> ### Note:  
> There is also a free plan for the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime and SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. To use the free plans for these runtimes, you have to configure the entitlements in the SAP BTP cockpit. You have one free plan for each runtime per global account and you can assign it to one subaccount at a time.

The tutorials are grouped in missions following a specific scenario. All the missions are based on the Incident Management sample application:
