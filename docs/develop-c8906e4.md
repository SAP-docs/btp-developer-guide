## Develop Applications, Extensions and Services with ABAP Cloud

You can develop new apps and services from scratch or to extend existing SAP or custom services in an upgrade-safe way. To create a new app and services, you implement the domain-specific implementation including the respective data model and business logic according to the selected use case. All domain-specific data models based on RAP architecture blueprint bring extensibility as a built-in quality. Generally, extensibility is based on an opt-in approach, meaning that the original data model or service must be enabled for the different extensibility use cases.
