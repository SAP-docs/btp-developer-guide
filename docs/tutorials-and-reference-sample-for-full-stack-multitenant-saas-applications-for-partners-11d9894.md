# Tutorials and Reference Sample for Full-Stack Multitenant SaaS Applications for Partners

The Poetry Slam Manager application is a reference for SAP partners that provides you with a recommended way to becoming a SaaS provider of multitenant applications based on the SAP BTP. See [Partner Reference Application 'Poetry Slam Manager'](https://github.com/SAP-samples/partner-reference-application/) on GitHub.

The guidance covers building, running, and integrating scalable full-stack cloud applications using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) and adheres to the development recommendations set out in the SAP BTP Developerâ€™s Guide. It includes an ERP-agnostic design that lets you deliver your application as a side-by-side extension to consumers using any SAP solution, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Business One, and SAP Business ByDesign.

By using services in SAP BTP and the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\), your application meets SAP standards for enterprise-class business solutions and empowers you to focus on your application domain.

The reference application and its tutorials cover a wide range of services and components in SAP BTP. You can find a list of all services in the bill of materials of the partner reference application on GitHub. See [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/SAP-samples/partner-reference-application/blob/main/Tutorials/01-BillOfMaterials.md) on GitHub.

The tutorials in the repository follow an incremental development approach, guiding users through the development journey. They cover:

1.  Developing the core application with a focus on business models and logic.
2.  Enhancing the application to a multi-customer \(multitenant\) solution.
3.  Integrating with various ERP backends.
4.  Extending the application with additional features.
