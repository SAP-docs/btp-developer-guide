# Programming Model Specifics

Each programming model has certain aspects that are unique to it, such as the programming language but also other aspects related to the different run-times. In the following two sections, we provide concrete guidance for each of the two programming models:

-   [ABAP Cloud](abap-cloud-9aaaf65.md)

-   [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\)](sap-cloud-application-programming-model-cap-696ec23.md)


These sections also introduce you to a number of tutorials for each of the programming models, giving you step-by-step instructions on how to develop and deploy your applications. The tutorials include sample applications, which are designed to demonstrate the implementation of the recommendations in real-world business sceniarios. By studying these sample applications, you can see firsthand how the guidance can be applied and what the outcomes look like. They provide tangible examples that bridge theory and practice, making it easier for you to grasp and apply the concepts. This hands-on approach not only supplements your learning experience but also prepares you better for your own development projects.
