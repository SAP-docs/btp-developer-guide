# Administrate and Operate

Effective administration and operations are essential to ensure stable, efficient, and cost-optimized ABAP system performance in the cloud.

Administrators are responsible for managing users, roles, and subaccounts, as well as monitoring performance, optimizing resources, and maintaining integrations with connected systems.

Lifecycle management includes transports, add-on updates, and tenant administration for multi-tenant applications.

Key tools such as SAP Fiori Launchpad, Landscape Portal, and the Technical Monitoring Cockpit support daily operations, while SAP Cloud ALM provides health monitoring, alerts, and proactive notifications.

Additionally, ABAP Test Cockpit \(ATC\) helps maintain code quality and security standards across developments.

By applying these practices, administrators can ensure system health, efficient resource utilization, and smooth operation of custom applications in a cloud-centric ABAP landscape.

As an ABAP environment administrator, your role extends beyond traditional basic tasks. Core responsibilities include:

-   User and account management: Handle identity and access management, manage organizations, spaces, quotas, and roles.

-   System health monitoring: Track runtime performance, SQL statements, background jobs, response times, and errors.

-   System sizing and cost optimization: Monitor resource usage patterns, adjust sizing, and apply hibernation to save costs.

-   Lifecycle management: Oversee custom applications, transports, add-on updates, and tenant operations.

-   Integration monitoring: Ensure stable data exchange between cloud and on-premise systems.
