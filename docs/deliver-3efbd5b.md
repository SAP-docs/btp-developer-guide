# Deliver

Now that you have completed your design for the required user experience of your application along with the appropriate application architecture, itâ€™s time to deliver what you have designed. In other words, set up the development and test landscape, develop and test your application and finally release it to the productive environment. See:

-   You start by **setting up the landscape** in SAP BTP. See [Set Up](set-up-3b774f8.md).

-   Then, you continue with the development, choosing the **programming language, programming model, runtimes, tools** and others. Have in mind that depending on the programming model, there are some specifics. See

    -   [Develop](develop-and-build/develop-7e30686.md)

    -   [Programming Model Specifics](programming-model-specifics-cc37b7a.md)


-   There are **sample applications** presented in tutorials and end-to-end scenarios, called missions:
