## Business Application Services

As business applications are having common characteristics, you can benefit from an open architecture with as few as possible, but well documented, technology choices.

The architecure blueprint outlines ABAP Cloud and SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) as the best architecture styles to implement business applications. Both programming models integrate with SAP BTP services.

See [Business Application Services](business-application-services-f3641a5.md).
