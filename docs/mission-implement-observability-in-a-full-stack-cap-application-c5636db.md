# Mission: Implement Observability in a Full-Stack CAP Application

You can add observability to the Incident Management application. Observability helps make informed decisions using real-time data like logs, metrics, traces, and events. It provides insights into SAP and customer systems to improve efficiency, scalability, resilience, and availability.

For detailed observability data, use SAP Cloud Logging. SAP Cloud Logging allows you to analyze logs, metrics, and traces to understand the performance of your SAP BTP workload in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry, and SAP BTP, Kyma environments.

See [Implement Observability in a Full-Stack CAP Application Following SAP BTP Developerâ€™s Guide](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/4432/4718/).
