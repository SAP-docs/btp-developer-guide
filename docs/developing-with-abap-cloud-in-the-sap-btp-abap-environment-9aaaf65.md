# Developing with ABAP Cloud in the SAP BTP ABAP Environment



<a name="loio9aaaf650d02e42afba0e4b09e2991d78__section_sgv_1hw_czb"/>

## Overview

[ABAP Cloud](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-cloud/why-abap-cloud) is SAPâ€™s cloud-ready development model, used in the [SAP BTP ABAP environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/abap-environment/abap-environment) to build upgrade-stable extensions, services, and applications using released APIs and a restricted, cloud-safe ABAP language version. These are the main elements of the SAP BTP ABAP environment:

-   Core Data Services \(CDS\) for data modeling and embedded analytics

-   ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model \(RAP\) for service-based applications

-   Cloud-ready ABAP language version \(restricted to released statements and APIs\)

-   Released public SAP APIs and extension points for upgrade-stable extensibility and automation

-   ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse as the development environment

-   Reuse services and libraries, including number ranges, application jobs, the ABAP-integrated SAP Fiori launchpad, and a UI repository for SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori elements UIs

## Extensibility Options

These are the extensibility options on SAP BTP:

-   Low-Code / No-Code: SAP Build Apps, SAP Process Automation, SAP Build Work Zone

-   Pro-Code: SAP Build Code \(CAP for JavaScript/TypeScript\) and SAP BTP ABAP Environment \(ABAP Cloud development\)


SAP BTP Developer's Guide focuses on the pro-code option on SAP BTP for building robust, cloud-ready extensions using ABAP Cloud. See [Develop](develop-c8906e4.md).

## Integration in SAP Build

With SAP BTP ABAP environment integrated into SAP Build, you as a developer can create, access, and monitor ABAP Cloud projects directly from the SAP Build lobby, alongside low-code and CAP projects. This integration fosters fusion development, bridging ABAP and non-ABAP worlds and allows seamless collaboration across technologies within a single extensibility suite.

The SAP BTP ABAP environment brings the general advantages of the side-by-side approach:

-   Independent lifecycle and workload management

-   Separate user management and authorizations

-   Integration across multiple backend systems

-   Partner options to offer multitenant SaaS solutions or add-on product
